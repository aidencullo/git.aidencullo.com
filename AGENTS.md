# Agent Instructions

- Always push changes after completing requested work.
- Consult `AGENTS.md` (this file) for repo-specific instructions before taking actions.
- Use descriptive commit messages that summarize the change.
- Use `user:aidencullo`.
- Use `profile:github/aidencullo`.
- Keep commits fast with a single non-interactive flow: `git add -A && git commit -m "<message>" && git push`.
